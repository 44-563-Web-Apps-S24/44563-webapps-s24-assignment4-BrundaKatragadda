    <h6 style="color: olive;">Anton Pavlovich Chekhov : THE BEAR</h6>
    <p>
   <p class= "direction" >[Enter LUKA with the vodka.]</p>
    <br>

<b><h6>LUKA.</h6></b><p>You allow yourself to go very far, sir....</p> 
<br>
<b><h6>SMIRNOV.</h6></b><p class= "direction" >[Angrily] What?</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><h6>LUKA.</h6></b><p>I... er... nothing... I really...</p>
<br>
<b><h6>SMIRNOV.</h6></b><p> are you talking to? Shut up!</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><h6>LUKA.</h6></b> <p class= "direction" >[Aside] The devil's come to stay.... Bad luck that brought him....</p>
[Exit.]
<br>
<b><h6>SMIRNOV.</h6></b><p>Oh, how angry I am! So angry that I think I could grind the
whole world to dust.... I even feel sick.... <p class= "direction" >[Yells] Waiter!</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class= "direction" >[Enter POPOVA.]</p>
<br>
<b><h6>POPOVA.</h6></b><p class= "direction" >[Her eyes downcast] Sir, in my solitude I have grown
unaccustomed to the masculine voice, and I can't stand shouting. I must
ask you not to disturb my peace.</p>
<br>
<b><h6>SMIRNOV.</h6></b><p>Pay me the money, and I'll go.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><h6>POPOVA.</h6></b><p>I told you perfectly plainly; I haven't any money to spare; wait
until the day after to-morrow.</p>
<br>
<b><h6>SMIRNOV.</h6></b><p>And I told you perfectly plainly I don't want the money the day
after to-morrow, but to-day. If you don't pay me to-day, I'll have to
hang myself to-morrow.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><h6><p></h6></b>But what can I do if I haven't got the money? You're so strange!</p>
<br>
<b><h6>SMIRNOV.</h6></b><p>you won't pay me now? Eh?</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><h6>POPOVA.</h6></b><p>can't.</p>
<br>
<b><h6>SMIRNOV.</h6></b> <p>that case I stay here and shall wait until I get it. [Sits
down] You're going to pay me the day after to-morrow? Very well! I'll
stay here until the day after to-morrow. I'll sit here all the time....
[Jumps up] I ask you: Have I got to pay the interest to-morrow, or
haven't I? Or do you think I'm doing this for a joke?</p>
