    <h1>Katragadda Brunda does Chekov tonight</h1>
    <h6 style="color: olive;">Anton Pavlovich Chekhov : THE BEAR</h6>
    <p>
    [Enter LUKA with the vodka.]
    <br>

<b>LUKA.</b> You allow yourself to go very far, sir....
<br>
<b>SMIRNOV.</b>[Angrily] What?
<br>
<br>
<b>LUKA.</b>  I... er... nothing... I really...
<br>
<b>SMIRNOV.</b> Whom are you talking to? Shut up!
<br>
<br>
<b>LUKA.</b> [Aside] The devil's come to stay.... Bad luck that brought him....
[Exit.]
<br>
<b>SMIRNOV.</b>Oh, how angry I am! So angry that I think I could grind the
whole world to dust.... I even feel sick.... [Yells] Waiter!
<br>
<br>
[Enter POPOVA.]
<br>
<b>POPOVA.</b>[Her eyes downcast] Sir, in my solitude I have grown
unaccustomed to the masculine voice, and I can't stand shouting. I must
ask you not to disturb my peace.
<br>
<b>SMIRNOV.</b> Pay me the money, and I'll go.
<br>
<br>
<b>POPOVA.</b>I told you perfectly plainly; I haven't any money to spare; wait
until the day after to-morrow.
<br>
<b>SMIRNOV.</b>And I told you perfectly plainly I don't want the money the day
after to-morrow, but to-day. If you don't pay me to-day, I'll have to
hang myself to-morrow.
<br>
<br>
<b>POPOVA.</b>But what can I do if I haven't got the money? You're so strange!
<br>
<b>SMIRNOV.</b> Then you won't pay me now? Eh?
<br>
<br>
<b>POPOVA.</b>I can't.
<br>
<b>SMIRNOV.</b> In that case I stay here and shall wait until I get it. [Sits
down] You're going to pay me the day after to-morrow? Very well! I'll
stay here until the day after to-morrow. I'll sit here all the time....
[Jumps up] I ask you: Have I got to pay the interest to-morrow, or
haven't I? Or do you think I'm doing this for a joke?
